# DNDSH

`dndsh` is a small REPL that does some stuff you'd want to do in DND!

You can `roll`, `check`, and check command `history`, and repeat previous commands using `!`
(like in bash, of course.)

## Prerequisites

Make sure that you have `cargo` and `git` installed on your machine.

## Installing and Running

In your command line, run:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/racecraftr/dndsh.git
cd dndsh
cargo run
```
